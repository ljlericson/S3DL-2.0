# S3DL-2.0
IMPORTANT: This is an abandoned and unfinished project.

This is a remake of another project I had called 's3dl' or 'simple 3d library', it was badly programmed and had lots of bugs. Hopefully s3gl or s3dl 2.0 turns out slightly better, I hope to not use SDL and instead experiment with other input libaries.

Also I don't know why I called this s3gl/s3dl 2.0, half way through the project I decided to not make a library and instead make some kind of game but I haven't been bothered to rename any of the files or this repo. So for now this is s3dl 2.0 until I think of a better name.
